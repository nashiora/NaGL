# NaGL
A simple OpenGL library for C#.

This project originated from a fork of SharpGL (https://github.com/dwmkerr/sharpgl).
I didn't like all of the features that were added and the complexity of the project,
so I dumbed it down to just the Core project minus just about everything.

Over time, I'll re-add features I want and change the code enough to be mine.
